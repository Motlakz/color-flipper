## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See the relevant color changes with each button click

### My Process

I replicated the basic markup from the repository and applied the logical approach I used to tackle the challenge to both my JS files. The HTML file I mostly worked on was the Index file, although the methods work just the same.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to further establish my DOM manipulation learning, which I am still working on.

### Continued development

I will invest more time in JavaScript Project-related practice to understand the logic behind some JavaScript concepts applied here.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is the best place to recap basics.
